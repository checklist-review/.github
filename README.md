⚡️ **Supporting the Project**

---

## 📘 Project Vision

The Checklist Review Toolchain is a modular system designed to enforce code quality through markdown-based checklists. It integrates seamlessly into developer workflows and CI/CD pipelines across multiple platforms.

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The toolchain consists of four main components:

- [`checklist-review-cli`](https://github.com/mPokornyETM/checklist-review-cli): Core CLI tool for validating markdown checklists
- [`checklist-review-vscode`](https://github.com/mPokornyETM/checklist-review-vscode): VS Code extension for inline checklist rendering and validation
- [`checklist-review-jenkins`](https://github.com/mPokornyETM/checklist-review-jenkins): Jenkins plugin for enforcing checklist validation in builds
- [`checklist-review-azure`](https://github.com/mPokornyETM/checklist-review-azure): Azure DevOps extension for checklist validation in pipelines

Each component is designed to work independently or together as part of a unified workflow.

> "Open source" does not mean "includes free support"

You can support the contributor and buy him a coffee.

Every second invested in an open-source project is a second you can't invest in your own family / friends / hobby.
That's the reason, why supporting the contributors is so important.

Thx very much for supporting us.
